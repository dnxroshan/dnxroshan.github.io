Hello there! My name is Dilnavas Roshan. I am from Kerala, India (If you don't know, Kerala is the southernmost state of India). I have created this blog to share some nerdy stuff with the world. I'll mostly write about programming, but you'll occasionally see posts related to physics, mathematics and philosophy.

A word about the name. I've spent a lot of time searching for a name for this blog. Whenever I hit with a good name, the corresponding domain name was not available. The domain name is either already registered or too expensive. Eventually, I came up with the name quantile (At that time I was doing some statistics), but the corresponding dot-com domain was not available. So I managed to register a dot-dev domain.
