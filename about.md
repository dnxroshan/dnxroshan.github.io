Hello there! My name is Dilnavas Roshan. I am from Kerala, India (If you don't know, Kerala is  the southern most state in India). I have created this blog to share some nerdy stuff with the world. I'll mostly write about programming, but you'll ocassionally see posts related to physics, mathematics and philosophy.
